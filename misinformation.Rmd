```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

misinfo_d <- read.csv('../data/life-under-lockdown-wave2-extract.csv')
```

```{r}
misinfo_d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = beliefs))+
  geom_histogram(bins=6)
```

```{r}
misinfo_d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gender))+
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
mean(misinfo_d$beliefs)
```
```{r}
misinfo_d %>%
  filter(gender %in% c('Female','male')) %>%
  t.test(formula = beliefs ~ gender, data = . )
```

In the sample, males had more misinformation beliefs(M=0.73) than females (M=0.61), but this was not statistically significant, t(491.3).
